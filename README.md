# Camera Store

## Project Overview
Camera Store is a web application designed to showcase and sell cameras and photography accessories. The application features a user-friendly interface allowing users to explore products, manage their shopping cart, and for administrators to add and update product listings. Built with a modern UI framework, it ensures a responsive and engaging experience for all visitors.

## Installation
To set up the Camera Store application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/camera-store.git
   cd camera-store
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:**
   Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it using your preferred web browser.

## Usage
- **Browsing Products:** Navigate to the home page to view featured products. Click on "View Products" to explore all available items.
- **Shopping Cart:** You can view and manage your cart from the cart page. If the cart is empty, add products to it from the product listing.
- **Admin Panel:** The admin page allows authorized users to add new products and manage existing listings.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The application utilizes Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive layout on all devices.
- **Dynamic Product Listing:** Products can be dynamically added and displayed on the homepage from the admin interface.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality:** Users can add products to their cart and view the cart summary.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The design prioritizes an intuitive user experience with easy navigation and clear call-to-action buttons.

## Dependencies
The project dependencies are mainly fetched from a CDN for front-end libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework to style the application.
- **Font Awesome:** A library for scalable vector icons.

There are no specific backend dependencies as the current setup is static front-end only. Future functionality (like order processing) would require additional libraries.
